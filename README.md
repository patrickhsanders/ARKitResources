### Simple
[Building a Simple ARKit Demo with SceneKit in Swift 4 and Xcode 9](https://www.appcoda.com/arkit-introduction-scenekit/) **[AppCoda]** 
> A good introductory tutorial on ARKit that lets you go from an empty project to having virtual objects in the real world. Decent explanations of the apis as you move through allows for quick customization of the project. There may be easier ways to create ARKit projects now (new xcode templates), but this was by no means difficult.

### Design and Interface
[Creating Great AR Experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/805/) **[Apple]**
> Design focused. Explains how to get users to start interacting with ARKit, presenting content (with some cool non-camera based experiences e.g. 2D, VR) and interacting with the world. This talk also discussed best practices for producing 3D objects in ARKit for best performance.
